# Getting Started

### Run `npx create-react-skel <project-name>`

When propted, respond with `y` + <kbd>return</kbd>.

The starter command clones this repo and installs base dependencies.

## More Info

This is a stripped down version of the `npx create-react-app` command that we all know and love. `create-react-skel <project-name>` also includes some CSS boilerplate to zero out margin, padding, border, outline, list style, and text decoration, and sets box sizing to `border-box`. It also adds a `./src/components` directory with a `TestComponent.jsx` file.

Unlike `npx create-react-app`, `.` is not a vaild directory name argument.

## Next Steps

`react-skel` removes the remote from the cloned repository. Run `git init` and `git remote add origin <remote-url>` to connect to your desired remote repository.

Alternatively, you can click [here](https://github.com/austin-rt/create-react-skeleton/generate) to create a new repo using this same template.

Find the npm package [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-react-skel).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can still run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Still builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
