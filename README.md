# Getting Started

This is a stripped version of the known and loved command `npx create-react-app <project-name>`. We've included some proper CSS boilerplate to zero out padding, margin, etc, as well as a `./src/components` directory with a `Test.jsx` component.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npx @austinrt/create-react-skeleton <project-name>`

Clones the existing repo and installs all dependencies. \
When propted, respond with `y` + <kbd>return</kbd>.

Alternatively, you can click [here](https://github.com/austin-rt/create-react-skeleton/generate) to use create a repo using this template.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
